# Sharker Shop with Vanilla Node.JS

## Why Vanilla Node.js?
I've decided to make a website without a framework like Express.JS because there are a lof of developers out there that don't have any interest or skills in pure Node.Js. Therefore, I longing to have a deep knowledge about the funcionalities of Node.Js

## Who Am I?
I'm a student at UFCSPA in Porto Alegre, Brasil. Currently, I'm studying a course that is about medicine with computer science called biomedical informatics.
